# Manager README

## Motivation behind this document

I wrote this document to share my expectations on what would make it most effective to work  together, and so that you can hold me accountable for it. Use this document as an intro into my mind and how I like to operate: my mental and operational frameworks. 

## My job at WeTransfer

As the Lead Frontend Engineer at WeTransfer, I’m measured by:
* Educating and inspiring frontend engineers to set the bar high, through technical coaching, setting goals and leading by example.
* Ensuring a general level of code quality, test coverage and best working practices.
* Ensuring that the frontend choices we are making align with the mid and long term product strategy for the company.
* Working with the other Lead Engineers to make sure we build the right thing in the right way, across the entire stack.
* Recruiting top frontend talent into our teams.

**I serve you**, not the other way around. I’m always able to assist, please ask me questions. You work for WeTransfer, not for me nor for your direct manager. I make mistakes, and I want to improve just like you. 


## My goal

Create a world-class engineering culture amongst the frontend engineers.

## My values

* Conflicts are crucial for change, and you feel safe debating with me or any other colleague. I find that ideas improve by being examined from all angles, even though I have certain expertise and experience that could make me blind. Please disagree with me, and let's have a safe debate. Ideas don’t get better with agreement.
* You’re very good at your job. You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t. If it feels like I’m questioning you it’s because I’m either: a) Trying to get context. Or b) Trying to get context c) Repeating myself ;)
* Knowledge sharing is key to grow. Expect from me to give feedback on the code you write, to spend some time pair programming, to organize coding kata sessions. But also, I expect from you to do the same. There is no better way for learning than sharing.
* You’ll let me know if you can’t do your job. One of my main responsibilities is to ensure that you have the right environment to do your job. Unfortunately, I cannot be everywhere, so please let me know. I want to help you before things slip through the cracks.
* Bring me bad news sooner rather than later. The sooner I know the problem, the sooner I can help you to fix it.

## Personal quirks

* I argue with "passion" - I may raise my voice a little or get a bit red. I don't like it about myself, and I try to improve. I tell myself that "I'm all-in, all the time" but it's just me losing my temper. When you feel I crossed the line, tell me. It’s not my intent.
* There are very few things that make me happier than to be part of a debate, as long as we keep it professional and later on that day, people still enjoy their time together. I will acknowledge it often out loud at the end of such discussion: "That was a very much needed discussion. Thank you for going all-in, offering your point of view and different tradeoffs, now let's make a decision that we will all support.”
* I’m a big believer of [No broken windows theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory) when writing software. I like clean logs, automation, I’m obsessed with alphabetical order and right indentation and spacing (I know...), [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), etc. But don’t get me wrong, there is always a pragmatic approach for coding, bringing value to the user is more important than anything.
* I’m colour blind, a colour blind frontend engineer. People still gets surprised for some reason.

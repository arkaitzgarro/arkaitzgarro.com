# Feedback

## Receiving

Frequent, transparent feedback is critical for building a strong culture and a thriving business. Feedback is instrumental in building trust. Without trust, communication breaks down. Building a culture of feedback and transparency starts and ends with the founders.
 
Critical feedback, in particular, should be cherished. Your team members are in the trenches every day. They have knowledge about the company that you do not have. Only if you open up the door to negative feedback will your team feel comfortable giving it. 

Think about it from the other side—it can be quite scary to criticize someone who has power over them. They might feel they’re risking their job! 

If you do not proactively collect feedback, you will quickly find the following problems emerge:

* **You will be in the dark about your company’s problems**: if every time your team brings up an issue you react defensively, they will soon stop bringing that valuable information to you, and you will wither away in your ivory tower.

* **Operations will grind to a halt**: when people aren’t able to share things openly, communication breaks down. When communication breaks down, operations slow. This problem only gets worse as your company grows, and as it grows it becomes ever harder to change that culture.

* **Your best talent will leave you**: A-players have no patience for defensiveness and amateurishness. If you aren’t mature enough to listen to your people, face your problems, and work on fixing them, your A-players will find the founders who are.

Therefore, if you are to receive real, honest feedback and improve, and keep your team communicating, YOU must make the effort to seek it out. Do so using the five A’s:

1. **Ask for it**: make sure your team understands that giving you negative feedback will not be punished, but cherished. It is important to explicitly say this to them, preferably in a one-on-one setting. When asking for feedback on the company in general, it is useful to ask, "If you were CEO, what would you change?" You can do this in person or through an anonymous survey. When asking for feedback about himself as a manager, Lachy Groom, formerly of Stripe, asks "What feedback are you afraid to give because you think it will hurt my feelings?  Please tell me that."

2. **Acknowledge it**. Confirm that you heard it correctly by saying **"I think I heard you say..."** Summarize what they said. Then say **"Is that right?"** If they **"Yes"**, you are done. If they say "Not quite", ask them to say it again until you are able to summarize it correctly. Once you have summarized correctly what they said, you can even go deeper by asking **"Is there more?"**

This is the single most powerful tool that I know of to create trust and connection. People want to feel heard. And they can only know that you heard them if you actually say back their words to them. (Oddly, this step is actually more impactful than acting on their feedback.)

To confirm this, ask the person: **"Do you feel heard?"**

3. **Appreciate it**. Simply say **"Thank you"** for the precious gift that they are giving you. Don’t make excuses. Don’t argue back. Just say "Thank you."

4. **Accept it (or not)**. Declare whether or not you accept it. You do not have to accept the feedback. You just need to declare whether or not you accept it. There may well be feedback that you do not accept (ie- that you do not agree with philosophically). If so, explain why. If you do accept it, however, then...

5. **Act on it**. Co-create an action item that will effectively address the feedback. Put a due date on it. Do it. And then let the feedback-giver know that you did the action. When you do, you will have completed the feedback loop. And the feedback-giver will then have gained trust that you actually want feedback and are committed to improving. Publish this feedback and action item widely to the organization. Only then will your team members feel confident that their voices are heard, and safe enough to give you further feedback.

## Giving 

When giving feedback, it is critical to use a 2-way communication method (in person is best, a video call is OK, an audio call is least good). This is so that you can see the person’s reaction. If they get defensive and angry, you will be able to see that and say: "I didn't intend to make you feel angry. My intent was to be helpful." This will hopefully mollify their anger.

If, on the other hand, you use a 1-way communication method (email, text, voicemail), then the recipient can easily become defensive and angry without you realizing it. And because you don’t notice the anger, you won’t be able to address it. Unaddressed, that anger will soon turn into resentment towards you. Therefore, **do NOT use a 1-way communication method (email, text, voicemail) to give feedback, unless it is 100% positive**. There is one exception to this rule: If you already know (without a doubt) the person to be open, curious and desirous of critical feedback.

There are three levels of feedback that you can give:
1. Relative
2. Absolute
3. Deep (emotion-based)

### Relative Feedback

This is simple feedback that allows the recipient to improve from whatever position they are in. 

Here is the template:

* Like. I like that you did... This should be an action that occurred, not a generic character trait. 
  * Good example: "You said hello to me when I walked in the door yesterday."
  * Bad example: "You are nice."
* Wish That. I wish that you would do... Again, this should be a specific positive action.
  * Good example: "Say goodbye to me whenever you leave the room."
  * Bad example: "Don’t be rude."

### Absolute Feedback

People also need to know where they stand on an absolute basis. Do not wait until year-end Performance Reviews. Most people have constant anxiety when they aren’t sure where they stand. Giving absolute feedback regularly (in every 1-1) will eliminate this anxiety. Bad news is less anxiety-inducing than no news.

To give it, state:

* Your current rating for your job function, 0-10, is...
  * 8-10 is on or above expectation.
  * 6-7 is below expectation, but can easily be improved to expectation with Wish That guidance.
  * 5 or below is far below expectation. You are now being put on a written Performance Improvement Plan.
* What you did that I liked is ...
* To achieve a 10, you would do ...

### Deep (emotions-based) Feedback
 
Finally, there is deep emotions-based feedback. Do this when there is more time (offsite).

Here is a template for providing this feedback, adapted from the book Nonviolent Communication, by Marshall B. Rosenberg.

* Ask for permission. Give the receiver a little heads-up of what’s coming. It can be enough to say 
  * **"I have something to communicate to you, is now a good time?"**
* State your emotion in terms of anger, sadness, fear, joy, and excitement (**feeling**). This is perhaps the hardest part for you to do. Talking about your feelings might not be something you are used to, so it might be challenging at first. However, doing so is crucial for the other person to truly understand where you are coming from and to take your feedback to heart. You may think, I’m not angry, I’m just frustrated. Well, that is just a lesser version of anger. Just as all colors are composed of the primary red, yellow and blue, all emotions are a version or mixture of the base emotions listed above.
  * **"I feel anger."**
* State the facts as you perceive them (**facts**). Be very careful to state only pure facts, as a video camera would record them. (This is a challenge for many people to do. Keep it very short. If it is hard for you, simply skip this step and go right to Story.) An example of not fact: "You disrespected me." An example of fact:
  * **"You walked in the door this morning and I did not hear you say hello."**
* Now state the thoughts, opinions and judgments (*story*) you have around this situation. 
  * **"The thought that I have is..."**, or
  * **"The story that I am telling myself is..."**
* If you want to go to the advanced level (see explanation in the next section below), describe what you did to create this situation.
  * "I created this situation by..."
* Make a **request** of what you would like to see. Try to frame it as positive action ("do x") rather than a negative ("don’t do y").
* "My request is that you..."
* Ask if the person accepts the feedback and the request. If yes, then hold them accountable to doing it.
 
Giving and receiving frequent and transparent feedback may be painful at first. Often when companies start implementing this, it brings up a lot of underlying resentment and repressed issues. However, if you hang in there, you will find that the amount and intensity of feedback diminishes substantially, and your team will be noticeably happier and more productive.

The next level of feedback, whether it is Relative, Absolute or Deep, is to recognize your own part in creating the situation. If you view each issue as being caused by others or things outside of you, then you will feel and act like a victim, and give away your power to create the world you want to live in. Conversely, if you are willing to articulate how you created the situation, you take back your power, and will be more clearly able to see how you can change the current situation, as well prevent the situation from happening again in the future.

To do this, in Deep feedback, before making a request, state: "**I created this situation by...**." Then write out (or say) all the steps needed to create this situation. 

In conscious leadership terminology, this is called "taking 100% responsibility."

One of the most common issues that I hear from Managers of why they don’t want to give transparent feedback:

"Person X on my team is not performing well. But there is no one else that can do their job. My plan is to eventually hire someone to replace X. But in the meantime, if I give X real and honest feedback, I am afraid that they will quit, and then I’ll be totally screwed."

This is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you do not give someone feedback, then, by definition, they will fail.

If, however, you give feedback as a gift (using the script above), then the receiver will likely receive it well, and one of two magical things will happen:
* They will work hard to improve and perform the way that you hope, or
* They will admit to you that they cannot perform the job, and actively help you find their replacement.

Withholding feedback is never the best answer!

A note on expressing feelings:

When you give clear feedback, it is very possible that the receiver will cry. This is not a bad sign. For many people, crying is a very effective way of releasing emotion. Allow the person the space to cry. Be OK with it. Just breathe. Don’t try to stop their crying or cut it off by talking to them or putting your hand on their shoulder. Rather, allow them to cry as long as they need to (rarely lasts more than 1-2 minutes). Once they are done, they will feel much better, and you can both proceed productively. 

If we make it not OK to cry, then people have no way of releasing their emotion, and then that emotion becomes a mood … a bad one.
